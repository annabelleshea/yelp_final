# yelp_final
## When deploying on Streamlit, we chose the GitHub option and set the yelp_app.py file as the main file path.

# The dataset used is the Yelp Open dataset that's available here: https://www.yelp.com/dataset

# We first used the code in the downsample.py file to sample 1/5 of the reviews made by users with 5 or more reviews. This created a smaller dataset to work with.

# To further shrink the size of the dataset, we decided to only keep reviews about restaurants/food establishments in the filter.py file.
