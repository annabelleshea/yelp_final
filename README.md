# yelp_final
# When deploying on Streamlit, we chose the GitHub option and set the yelp_app.py file as the main file path.

# The dataset used is the Yelp Open dataset that's available here: https://www.yelp.com/dataset
# All 5 of the datasets were not uploaded to this GitHub repo as some of the datasets exceed 5 GB, which is over the upload limit on GitHub. We condensed the relevant features into a dataset that has been uploaded.
